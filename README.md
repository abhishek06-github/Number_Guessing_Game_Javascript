# Number_Guessing_Game_Javascript
The project is a simple number guessing game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1-100. The web page includes an input field and a button to submit the guess, and displays feedback on the user's guesses, number of guesses made. The page is styled with CSS and uses JavaScript to handle the game logic.
